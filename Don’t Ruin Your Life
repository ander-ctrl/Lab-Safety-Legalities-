Authorized Scope

All practice activities are limited to:
	•	Personal devices owned and controlled by me
	•	Locally hosted lab environments (VMs / containers)
	•	Intentionally vulnerable practice systems (DVWA, OWASP Juice Shop, Metasploitable, VulnHub)
	•	Approved cybersecurity training platforms (Hack The Box, TryHackMe, PortSwigger Web Security Academy)
	•	Network traffic generated by my own devices inside my controlled lab environment

Out of Scope

The following activities are strictly prohibited:
	•	Scanning or probing public IP ranges not explicitly authorized
	•	Testing networks I do not own (public WiFi, workplace networks, neighbors, etc.)
	•	Packet sniffing or intercepting third-party traffic
	•	Brute forcing credentials on real services or accounts
	•	Exploiting vulnerabilities outside of approved lab targets
	•	Phishing or social engineering real individuals
	•	Denial-of-service testing against any production system

Safe Testing Rules

To prevent accidental disruption or unauthorized access:
	•	All offensive tooling is restricted to sandboxed lab environments
	•	Vulnerability scanning is limited to authorized IP ranges only
	•	No sensitive data is collected or stored
	•	Any discovered credentials or tokens are treated as sensitive and are not used
	•	Lab networks are isolated from personal and production devices whenever possible

Documentation & Accountability

For each lab session, I document:
	•	the target environment
	•	tools used
	•	commands executed
	•	results observed
	•	key takeaways and next steps

This ensures transparency, reinforces responsible learning, and supports reproducibility.

Guiding Principle

If I do not have explicit permission to test a system, it is not a target.
